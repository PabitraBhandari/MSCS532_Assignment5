# Quicksort Implementation and Analysis

### 1. Quicksort Implementation
The Quicksort algorithm is a well-known divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. The basic idea involves selecting a "pivot" element and partitioning the array into elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot. The algorithm then recursively sorts the subarrays. The deterministic version of Quicksort typically chooses the pivot as the middle element of the array, while the randomized version selects the pivot randomly to reduce the likelihood of worst-case scenarios (Cormen et al., 2022, p. 182).

### 2. Performance Analysis

#### Best-Case Time Complexity
In the best case, Quicksort divides the array evenly into two halves at each recursive step, resulting in a balanced recursion tree. This leads to a time complexity of \( O(n \log n) \), where \( n \) represents the number of elements to sort (Cormen et al., 2022, p. 187).

#### Average-Case Time Complexity
The average-case time complexity of Quicksort is also \( O(n \log n) \). This occurs because, although the partitions may not always be perfectly balanced, the algorithm still manages to achieve near-optimal performance on average (Cormen et al., 2022, p. 187).

#### Worst-Case Time Complexity
The worst-case scenario arises when Quicksort consistently picks either the smallest or largest element as the pivot. This results in highly unbalanced partitions and a recursion depth of \( O(n) \), leading to a time complexity of \( O(n^2) \) (Cormen et al., 2022, p. 189).

#### Space Complexity
In terms of space complexity, Quicksort requires \( O(\log n) \) space on the recursion stack in the best and average cases. However, in the worst case, the recursion depth can reach \( O(n) \), leading to a space complexity of \( O(n) \) (Cormen et al., 2022, p. 193).

### 3. Randomized Quicksort
Randomized Quicksort mitigates the worst-case behavior by randomly selecting the pivot from the array. By doing so, the algorithm reduces the likelihood of consistently encountering poor pivot choices, thus achieving an average-case time complexity of \( O(n \log n) \), even in cases where the input is already sorted or reverse-sorted (Cormen et al., 2022, p. 191). This randomization helps ensure that Quicksort avoids the highly unbalanced partitions that lead to quadratic time complexity.

### 4. Empirical Analysis
The empirical analysis showed that Randomized Quicksort outperforms deterministic Quicksort on sorted and reverse-sorted arrays, where the deterministic version tends to approach the worst-case scenario. This behavior is expected based on the theoretical analysis from Chapter 8, where randomized algorithms are discussed as a way to optimize performance and minimize the likelihood of encountering the worst-case scenario (Cormen et al., 2022, p. 205).

### Empirical Results

### Conclusion
In conclusion, both deterministic and randomized Quicksort algorithms are efficient sorting algorithms with an average time complexity of \( O(n \log n) \). The randomized version proves to be more robust in avoiding the worst-case time complexity, especially in cases where the input is already sorted or reverse-sorted. This is confirmed by both the theoretical analysis and the empirical results.
